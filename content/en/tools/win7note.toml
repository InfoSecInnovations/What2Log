Officially, support for Windows 7 ended on January 14, 2020 and it is \
recommended that users upgrade to Windows 10. However, the logging process is \
identical in Windows 10 and Windows 7, and links have been included to the \
Windows 10 section for each specific issue instead of a repeat of the above \
sections. There may be minor visual differences between the two OS’s but overall, \
the process and logs are the same.
