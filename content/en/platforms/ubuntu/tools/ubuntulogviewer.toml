txt = """
Linux versions that are Ubuntu based have a built in GUI application for viewing \
logs. This app is simply called Logs in the Ubuntu interface and is very similar \
to the one that is used by Mac but often lacks a lot of the controls that are \
useful when it comes to logging. To navigate to the logs application in Ubuntu, \
select the Show Applications icon in the dock.

From here, type in “logs” and select the logs application.

txt = """
Upon launching, the logs main/home screen will show. The log application \
interface is fairly straightforward and simple. The application generally \
launches on the important tab, which will show only the few most important \
logs, such as major errors.
"""

[[content]]
txt = """
The “All” tab is a list of all the events from the logs compiled and then \
sorted in order of time. This is a good way to see all the events at a particular \
time. The Applications, System, Security, and Hardware tabs are all a list of \
the events that relate to that particular topic. For example, the Applications \
tab shows information relating to the computers applications such as launching \
and minor tasks they do.

The top of the logs window displays a drop down option. This option allows the \
user to select which logs they want to view from which boot of the machine. By \
default, this is set to the current machine boot log.
"""

txt = """
In the top right of the application window, there are three options. Number 1 \
is the search function and allows a user to search for a particular string in \
the log file. You can also press control and F to activate the search function.
"""

[[content]]
txt = """
Number 2 gives the user the option to export the logs to a file. Finally, \
Number 3 gives the user the option to open a new window, get help, or gain \
info about the application. The logs application is not a great application \
for viewing logs due to restrictions such as not being able to search for a \
term that has spaces in it.
