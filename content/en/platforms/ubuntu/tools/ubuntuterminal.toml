Unlike Windows dependence on WevtUtil, Linux logs do not require a specific \
command to view or sort. In fact, there are a variety of commands that can be \
used and combined to sort and view the log files.  This site uses the grep \
command to sort and filter the log file, but the less or tail commands can also \
be used.
