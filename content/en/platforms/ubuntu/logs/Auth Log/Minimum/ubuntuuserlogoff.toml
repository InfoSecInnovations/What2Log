Linux logs call a user logoff event session closed. There may be logs from a \
“user” called GDM; this is just the graphical login screen and will show up if \
a user switched accounts graphically. In order to view this event from the Logs \
application, select the Security tab and search for **closed**. Due to the \
restrictions of the GNOME Logs app, there will likely be several logs that \
contain “closed”, just look for the ones that say session closed for user.
