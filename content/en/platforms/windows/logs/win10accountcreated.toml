Account creation logs can indicate a suspicious new account that was \
created in preparation for an attack or someone trying to do things \
they necessarily shouldnâ€™t. It is also a good idea to know when there \
may be new users on the network so you are prepared for their activity. \
This log is required by NIST SP 800-53, HIPAA and PCI DSS regulations. \
It is also recommended under the NSA Cyber Event Forwarding Guidance.
