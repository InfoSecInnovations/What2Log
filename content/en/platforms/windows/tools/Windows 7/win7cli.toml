It is required to enter the command prompt as an administrator to ensure that \
you have complete access to the system and all the logs. In order to do this, \
right click the Command Prompt (highlighted in blue) and select “Run as \
Administrator”. This launches what is known as an elevated command prompt.

First, for logging purposes, a user should ensure they are located in the right
directory by entering the command ```cd C:\WINDOWS\system32``` If you are not
already in the correct folder, the command prompt will move you there and the
command line will now begin with **C:\WINDOWS\system32>**

The Command Prompt should be run as an administrator because the files that \
hold the logs require administrator access. If the command prompt is run without \
administrator access, the return of the commands will not give a user an information.
