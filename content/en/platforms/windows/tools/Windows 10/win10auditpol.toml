Auditpol.exe is the command line tool that What2Log utilizes to check the status \
of and enable or disable logs in Windows environments. It can be used in both \
Powershell and the Command prompt, but all of our examples utilize Powershell. \
Entering the command ```auditpol``` will return a list of the available commands.

txt = """
With the ```auditpol /list /category``` command, the user can see the list of \
categories they can edit with the auditpol command, of which there are 10.
"""

[[app.info]]
txt = """
Auditpol then breaks each of these main categories into several subcategories, \
which are what is edited when changing the audit policy. These subcategories \
can be viewed with the command ```auditpol /list /subcategory:*``` Our screenshot \
only shows a portion of the output.

In order to get the current status of an audit setting, the command is \
auditpol /get, which needs to be followed by a /category or /subcategory. Doing \
a category will give you a list of all the subcategories and their current \
settings, as shown with the command ```auditpol /get /category:System``` \
Replacing the name of the category with * will show all of the categories and \
subcategories with their current setting.
"""

Using the auditpol /get command with /subcategory, however, will only return \
the setting of a specific singular subcategory. For subcategories longer than 1 \
word, the name must be placed inside parentheses for it to be read correctly.
"""

[[app.info]]
txt = """
In order to enable or disable a log, the command is auditpol /set, which is then \
followed by a category or subcategory. After this, you must specify what you \
want to change and how. You can specify if you want to change the auditing of a \
success or failure, and then if you want to enable or disable them; both do not \
have to be changed. The auditpol command will then look something like \
```auditpol /set /subcategory:"Other System Events" /Success:Enable /Failure:Enable```
"""

txt = """
This command can also be applied to all categories at once, although it is not \
recommended. The changes made through the command line can also be observed in \
the group policy editor under Computer Configuration -> Windows Settings -> \
Security Settings -> Advanced Audit Policy Configuration -> System Audit \
Policies, as pictured.
