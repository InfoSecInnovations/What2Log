txt = """
Windows only natively logs software installation, software updates, and software \
deletion if it is done through Windows own MsiInstaller. This is important to \
note as there may be gaps in the logs and these logs will not account for every \
install on a device.
"""

txt = """
Another important note is the differences between Windows 10 Home and Windows \
10 Professional. As previously mentioned, Windows 10 Home does not have the \
group policy editor that is used to toggle certain logs in Windows 10 Professional. \
The logs (in particular, user login) are logged by default in Home. However, \
Windows 10 Home does not have user groups and logs such as Group creation, group \
deletion, etc. will not exist.
