The Windows 10 logs can be viewed either in the Command Prompt or in the \
PowerShell and there is no difference in the commands used. PowerShell, \
however, allows for a script to be written in order to automate the log process. \
To navigate to PowerShell, type powershell in the start menu. To enter the \
correct PowerShell app, the Windows PowerShell (highlighted in red) should be selected.

Much like the Command Prompt, PowerShell should be entered as an administrator \
and there are two ways to do so. The first is to click on number 1 (shown below) \
or right click on number 2 and select “run as administrator”. If the column on \
the right is not shown on your machine, simply use number 2.
